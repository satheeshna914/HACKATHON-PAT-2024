3. Peanut cropping involves cultivating peanuts, also known as groundnuts, primarily in warm climates. The crop requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Farmers plant peanuts directly into the soil, where they develop underground. Harvesting involves uprooting the entire plant and extracting the peanuts, which are rich in protein and oil, making them valuable commodities.
