Mother Teresa, born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in 1910, was a symbol of compassion and selflessness. She dedicated her life to serving the poor, sick, and marginalized in Kolkata, India, founding the Missionaries of Charity in 1950. Her work extended globally, reaching those in need across continents. Mother Teresa's unwavering commitment to the destitute earned her international acclaim and numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. She embodied love in action, living among the poorest of the poor and providing them with care, comfort, and dignity. Despite facing criticism and challenges, she remained steadfast in her mission until her death in 1997. Mother Teresa's legacy continues to inspire millions worldwide to embrace compassion and serve humanity with kindness and empathy.

Indira Gandhi, born in 1917, was the first female Prime Minister of India, serving from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, and played a significant role in shaping the nation's politics. Gandhi implemented key policies aimed at economic development, social justice, and nuclear disarmament. However, her tenure was also marked by authoritarianism, including the declaration of a state of emergency in 1975. Despite controversies, she remains a polarizing figure, admired for her strong leadership and criticized for her methods. Gandhi's legacy includes her contributions to India's progress as well as the challenges and debates surrounding her governance style and decisions.
